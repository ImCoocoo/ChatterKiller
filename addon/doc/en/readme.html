<h1>ChatterKiller â€“ by Jason Bratcher</h1>
<p>Jason Bratcher, Welcome to your new add-on. Please write instructions on how to use your addon in this file.
When you compile your addon, users can get help with it by activating addon help from the list item containing your addon in the Addons manager in NVDA.
Good documentation is both important for your success as an add-on author and also essential for a stable add-on, persuading other potential users to try it out!
Some helpful notes for me, but first, what does this add-on do?
Tired of NVDA saying "no previous", "no next", "top", "Bottom," "left", "right" while using the NVDA object navigator?
How about we change that to tones announcing the happening of reaching edge points instead of speech?
This oughta be good!
The only thing worth configuring in the _init.py file is the pitch, length, left and right volume of the tone variables that NVDA will follow hile this add-on is active.
So whenever you use the commands NVDA+NumPad4/NumPad6/NumPad8/NumPad2, instead of NVDA actually saying the earlier messages, NVDA will instead play preset tones that I've coded.
Left side alerts will be panned left to indicate you can't go any further.
The same thing happens with tones panned to the right.
Octave tones are used to denote the beginning/end of a line.
Now when the tones are heard, NVDA Will Still Say whatever you're located on.
So with this add-on installed:
After restarting NVDA (unless you've turnde off the Focus Moves Navigator Object function, the object navigator is in the exact same place as NVDA's focus.
If you did turn off Review Follows Focus with NVDA+7 (number row above the letters), your focus then gets put on the Desktop.
Let's have some fun, shall we?
You can use NVDA+NumPad5 to find out the exact focus of the object navigator.
Use the NumPad1 and NumPad3 commands to left or right a single character at a time through the focused text;
check out what happens when you reach either end of the word/phrase at focus?
No "left" or "right" message. Just a tone (panned hard left/right) to indicate you CanNot Go AnyFurther than that.
Go ahead and use NVDA+NumPad4/NVDA+NumPad6 to move left/right through the object sibblings on this row.
If there are not any others, a tone plays either hard left/right to tell you that.
Or if there are other objects, you'll be able to navigate through them.
The tone only plays when you're at the beginning/end of the row of objects.
How cool is that!
That's pretty much the jist of this add-on;
I - might - consider other conditions, like objects being defunct (no longer available) or off-screen (according to NVDA it's not in focus now).</p>
<p>Now for the development notes:
To build this addon, please visit [building.md]
I hope you found this add-on creation process easy.
If you have any feedback, or instructions, please post  to <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/nvda-addons">The add-on development list</a>.
Additionally, Please review the <a href="http://addons.nvda-project.org/dev.en.html">Add-ons development pages</a>, and you are strongly encouraged to submit your add-on for review.
The review process checks for 5 things.
1. "Legality
Is your code GPL V.2. (since NVDA is also GPL V.2. and your add-on is a part of NVDA during execution)?
Also know that pirating speech synthesisers/doing other shady  things won't be approved."
Yes.
This software is indeed licensed under GPL V2 from June of 1991.
2. "Watch Out For Evil
Does your code do anything dangerous/malicious?"
No.
I wouldn't hope to perform any malicious tasks with NVDA.
After all it's my daily driver and best to put it to good use, not use it in, say, an Indian scam call center.
Lest I then be featured in one of the ScammerPayBack videos, lol?
3. "Security Check
Does your code contain any blatent security voneribilities that effect NVDA?
If found you must  fix it/them before your next release."
No.
None that I know of.
4. "Simple quality check
Does the add-on break functionality of NVDA in potentially annoying ways/make NVDA hard to use?"
No.
That's why I'm writing this documentation;
so things actually do make sense out of the box.
This is a potential quality-of-life improvement add-on for me, but Not Everyone Will find it useful.
5. "Clarity
Is the documentation written so that an 'average joe" can figure out how this add-on works - without reading any of its source code?
Yes.
I did that earlier.</p>
